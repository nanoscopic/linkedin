# Unofficial LinkedIn Bug Tracker

This repo is a placeholder to track publicly known bugs / issues with LinkedIn.

It has been created because LinkedIn has serious bugs that have been there for multiple years and the maintainers of the product seem to be ignoring them.

This repo is not for trashing Microsoft or the maintainers but to have a place where issues can be reasonably tracked in a public fashion so as to answer the question "Is it already well known that this bug exists on LinkedIn?"

Please behave in an orderly fashion. Describe and discuss bugs in a technical "this is what happens". Speculation on why things happen or who is to blame is not needed and would be counterproductive.

This repo and its associated tickets are not official in any fashion. No one at LinkedIn ( that I'm aware of ) checks this repos or its tickets. There is no expectation that anything reported here will be corrected either soon or ever.
